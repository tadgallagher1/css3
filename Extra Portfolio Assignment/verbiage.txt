My Portfolio


Web Designer




Hi There!

Iâ€™m a web designer and programmer. As a customer myself, I expect a lot and so should you.

A graduate of Palm Beach Code School in West Palm Beach, I come to the web development industry with enthusiasm for excellence and inspired functional design. Friendly interfaces, graceful navigation and intuitive design are my passion.

Available to download are various formats of my resume, as well as links to samples of my work finished throughout the Web Development Program at PBCS. I would be delighted to entertain opportunities in the surrounding areas.
